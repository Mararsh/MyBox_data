# MyBox: Set of Easy Tools
This is GUI program based on JavaFx to provide simple and easy functions. It's free and open sources

Notice: "Geography Code" and "Epidemic Report" will be redesigned in v6.3. 
Please do not input your data of the 2 tables with current version, because this new version can not guarantee to migrate data of current version. 
But MyBox will try best to help users to export data in new tables format. So sorry about this!        


## Download and Execution
Packages of each version have been uploaded at [Releases](https://github.com/Mararsh/MyBox/releases?) directory now. You can find them by clicking `releases` tab in main page of this project.

### Self-contain packages 
Self-contain packages include all files and need not java env and installation.   (Please unpack it under path with pure-English name.)   
 
| Platform | Link | Size | Launcher |    
| --- | --- | ---  | ---  |    
| win | [MyBox-6.2.1-win.zip](https://github.com/Mararsh/MyBox/releases/download/v6.2.1/MyBox-6.2.1-win-exe.zip)  | 258MB | MyBox.exe |       
| linux | [MyBox-6.2.1-linux.tar.gz](https://github.com/Mararsh/MyBox/releases/download/v6.2.1/MyBox-6.2.1-linux.tar.gz)  | 217MB  | bin/MyBox  |     
| mac | [MyBox-6.2.1-mac.dmg](https://github.com/Mararsh/MyBox/releases/download/v6.2.1/MyBox-6.2.1-mac.dmg)  | 218MB  |  MyBox-6.2.1.app   |   

User can double click the launcher to start MyBox or run it by command line. The default "Open Method" of image/text/PDF files can be associated to MyBox and a file can be opened directly by MyBox by double clicking the file's name.
(File with name including non-ascii can not be opened by double clicking currently)

### Jar 
When JRE or JDK 13 or higher(`Oracle jdk` or `open jdk`) is installed, jar can run:    
  
| Platform | Link | Size | Requirements |   
| --- | --- | ---  | ---  |    
| win | [MyBox-6.2.1-win-jar.zip](https://github.com/Mararsh/MyBox/releases/download/v6.2.1/MyBox-6.2.1-win-jar.zip)  | 145MB | Java 13.0.1 or higher |    
| linux | [MyBox-6.2.1-linux-jar.zip](https://github.com/Mararsh/MyBox/releases/download/v6.2.1/MyBox-6.2.1-linux-jar.zip)  | 152MB  | Java 13.0.1 or higher |    
| mac | [MyBox-6.2.1-mac-jar.zip](https://github.com/Mararsh/MyBox/releases/download/v6.2.1/MyBox-6.2.1-mac-jar.zip)  |  148MB  | Java 13.0.1 or higher |    
 
    
Run following command to launch this program with Jar package: 
<PRE><CODE>     java   -jar   MyBox-6.2.1.jar</CODE></PRE>
	
A file path can follow the command as argument to be opened directly by MyBox. Example, following command will open the image:    
<PRE><CODE>     java   -jar   MyBox-6.2.1.jar   /tmp/a1.jpg</CODE></PRE>   

### Other addresses to download   
Download from cloud storage: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fWMRzym_jh075OCX0D8y8A#list/path=%2F   
Download from sourceforge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mara-mybox/files/   

## Limitation   
Self-contain packages can not be lanuched under path including non-English characters.  And file with name including non-ascii can not be opened by double clicking.
A bug has been reported to jpackage dev team:
[JDK-8232936](http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8232936)   

Current version still does not support OCR on Linux/Mac. The reason is that the based tesseract libraries are different on different platforms and there are not out of box packages available.   
This requirement is delayed due to limited development time.

## Cross platforms <a id="Cross-platform"></a>       

MyBox is implemented in pure Java and based on open source codes, so it can run any platform which supports Java 13.
Previous versions are based on Java 8.

Recognizing texts in image/PDF(OCR) works only on Windows currently.    

## Internationalized <a id="Internationalized"></a> 
1. All codes of MyBox are internationalized.
2. User can switch language in time.
3. Currently MyBox supports Chinese and English. 
4. To support a new language is just to edit a new resource file.   
5. Support adding new languages online. Table is provided with English as comparison. New langauges take effects at once.    
6. Translated files can be shared with others: Put the files under "mybox_languages" of data path and MyBox is aware of them immediately.

3. View PDF file in image mode. DPI can be set to adjust resolution. Page can be cropped as images.
4. In image mode, recognize texts in PDF(OCR). 
   When OCR in batch, following can be set:
	-  Whether convert pages as images, or extract images from pages\
	-  DPI or scale ratio
	-  Nine algorithms about image enhancement
	-  Binary threshold
	-  Rotation angle

7. Compress images in PDF file. JPEG quality or threshold of black-white can be set.
8. Merge multiple PDF files.
9. Split a PDF file into multiple PDF files, by pages number, by files number, or by start-end list.
10. Extract images in PDF file. Page range can be set.
11. Extract texts in PDF file. Splitting line can be customized.

<PRE><CODE>     DerbyMode=embedded </CODE></PRE>  

Modify these parameters, except for DerbyMode, in time will cause MyBox restarts itself automatically.
